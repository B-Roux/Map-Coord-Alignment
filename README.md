# Required Packages (with apt/pip installation commands)

* Mesa: `sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-glx`
* NumPy: `sudo pip install numpy`
* OpenCV: `sudo pip install opencv-python`
* Git: `sudo apt-get install git`

# Install

You should now be able to download and install this repository:

```git clone https://github.com/B-Roux/Map-Coord-Alignment.git```

# Run

There should now be a new `Map-Coord-Alignment` directory. In this, there is an `exampledriver.py` file which will demonstrate how to use the module.
Please note that this file is NOT COMPLETE! It has several areas marked with `TODO` comments - these areas need to be changed to suit your use case, or the example driver will not run!
